**ATMega4809 Basic

This is a basic example of bringing up the ATMega 4809 and enabling
the most common hardware. I wrote this so I could use it to control
various features in RC aircraft (telemetry and lights mostly).

Free for non-comercial use.  Contact me if you want to do something
comercial with it.
